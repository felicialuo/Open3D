# Real-time 3D Reconstruction via RGB-D Camera
This is my implementation of real-time 3D reconstruction using Intel RealSense D435i RGB-D camera, following this [official tutorial](http://www.open3d.org/docs/latest/tutorial/t_reconstruction_system/index.html).

## Set up Environment
Tested on Windows 10, with AMDÂ® Ryzen 9 7900x & NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti.
```bash
conda create --name open3d
conda activate open3d
conda install pip
pip install open3d
pip install pyrealsense2
pip install opencv-python
```

## Capture Your Own Dataset
Tips for capturing:
- Capture scene with feature, not plain wall
- Capture as holistic space as possible, and walk toward further for accuracy
  
Follow [Capture your own dataset tutorial](http://www.open3d.org/docs/latest/tutorial/reconstruction_system/capture_your_own_dataset.html#capture-your-own-dataset)
- Change directory to: Open3D\examples\python\reconstruction_system\sensors
- Output in: Open3D\examples\python\reconstruction_system\dataset
- run: `python realsense_recorder.py --record_imgs`
- Move `\reconstruction_system\dataset` to `\t_reconstruction_system`
- Change directory to `Open3D\examples\python\t_reconstruction_system`
- Create a new FL_config.yml
    - copy defaul_config.yml
    - modify:
     ```
     path_dataset: dataset
     path_intrinsic: FL_camera_intrinsic.json
     ```
Alternatively, you can record from RealSense Viewer and save a bag file
- then in FL_config.yml, modify: `path_dataset: 20231010_011717.bag # only if recorded with realsense viewer`

Make sure the directory structure is as follow
```
t_reconstruction_system
	-> dense_slam_gui.py # to run
	-> FL_camera_intrisic.python
	-> FL_config.yml
	-> dataset
		-> color
		-> depth
	-> 20231010_011717.bag # only if recorded with realsense viewer
# will be created
	-> output.log
	-> output.npz
	-> output.ply
```

## Run reconstruction
Follow [reconstruction tutorial](http://www.open3d.org/docs/latest/tutorial/t_reconstruction_system/index.html)
```
python dense_slam_gui.py --device "CUDA:0" --config FL_config.yml
```

Open3D is an open-source library that supports rapid development of software
that deals with 3D data. The Open3D frontend exposes a set of carefully selected
data structures and algorithms in both C++ and Python. The backend is highly
optimized and is set up for parallelization. We welcome contributions from
the open-source community.
